  - It's the key to that strange book I found.
  - Oh my god...
  - This book describes an ancient ritual used to summon a demon of great power.
  - Over the centuries, this demon has been used to do the bidding of whoever possessed
    the book. It would kill anyone who stood in the way of it's master's goals.
  - But if the summoner wasn't strong willed enough, the demon would break free and
    kill until it was stopped.
  - The book describes a ritual that can be used to send the demon back to Hell.
    It requires the blood of an innocent victim and a container to hold it.
  - I'll need to find a bottle and fill it with the blood of an innocent victim.
    Then I can bring it back here to perform the ritual.

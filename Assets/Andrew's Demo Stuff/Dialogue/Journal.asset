  - This is Vincent Vincenzo's private journal.
  - '"9/17


    It''s all coming together! I''ve finally convinced the investors
    and the Vincenzo Resort is becoming a reality! All I need to do now buy the land."'
  - '"9/29


    Convincing the people of this crappy little town to sell to me is
    proving to be more difficult than I thought. Who''d have thought people would
    be so attached to this place."'
  - '"10/10


    I spoke in front of the whole congregation at church this week.
    I tried to explain why selling to me was better for everyone!"'
  - '"They basically ran me out of there like I was some kind of animal. Idiots.
    To my surprise, Father Gregory found me afterwards and told me he had a proposition."'
  - '"10/12


    It''s all set! I struck a deal with the priest and soon there won''t
    be anyone left to stand in my way."'
  - '"I was skeptical at first, but when the Father opened that secret passage by
    clicking the button under the altar, I was intrigued."'
  - '"Behind the church he showed me something incredible. A demon or monster or
    something... I don''t know. "'
  - '"Father Gregory has promised to use the beast to scare everyone out of town
    in exchange for a handsome sum. It better work."'

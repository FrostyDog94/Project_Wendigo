  - I'm so glad you could come!
  - Something eerie is going on in this town.
  - For the past few weeks people have been going missing. The ones who haven't disappeared
    are all moving away.
  - Soon there won't be anybody left! You have to find out what's going on.
  - I don't know if it matters, but the only other person I've seen all week is Father
    Gregory.
  - He was skulking around the other night like he was looking for someone. He looked
    scared.
  - Maybe he left something at the church that could explain what he was doing.
  - Be careful though. There's something out there. If you hear any footsteps that
    aren't your own, shut off your flashlight (Press 'F' to switch flashlight on/off)
  - Oh! Before I forget, I drew you this map so you won't get lost. (Press 'M' to
    open map)
